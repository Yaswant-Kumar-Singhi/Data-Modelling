#### What is Data?
The quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a program or process, which may be stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media for presentation or kept for future reference is called as data.

#### What is Big Data?
Big Data is a collection of data that is huge in volume yet growing exponentially with time. It is a data with so large size and complexity that none of traditional data management tools can store it or process it efficiently. Big data is also a data but with huge size.

##### Examples of Big Data
###### Following are some of the Big Data examples-
•	The New York Stock Exchange is an example of Big Data that generates about one terabyte of new trade data per day.
•	The statistic shows that 500+terabytes of new data get ingested into the databases of social media site Facebook, every day. This data is mainly generated in terms of photo and video uploads, message exchanges, putting comments etc.
•	A single Jet engine can generate 10+terabytes of data in 30 minutes of flight time. With many thousand flights per day, generation of data reaches up to many Petabytes.

#### Types of Big Data
##### Following are the types of Big Data:
1.	Structured
2.	Unstructured
3.	Semi-structured

#### Characteristics of Big Data
##### Big data can be described by the following characteristics:
•	Volume
•	Variety
•	Velocity
•	Variability


<strong> (i) Volume </strong> – The name Big Data itself is related to a size which is enormous. Size of data plays a very crucial role in determining value out of data. Also, whether a particular data can actually be considered as a Big Data or not, is dependent upon the volume of data. Hence, ‘Volume’ is one characteristic which needs to be considered while dealing with Big Data solutions.

<strong> (ii) Variety </strong> – The next aspect of Big Data is its variety.
Variety refers to heterogeneous sources and the nature of data, both structured and unstructured. During earlier days, spreadsheets and databases were the only sources of data considered by most of the applications. Nowadays, data in the form of emails, photos, videos, monitoring devices, PDFs, audio, etc. are also being considered in the analysis applications. This variety of unstructured data poses certain issues for storage, mining and analyzing data.

<strong> (iii) Velocity  </strong> – The term ‘velocity’ refers to the speed of generation of data. How fast the data is generated and processed to meet the demands, determines real potential in the data.
Big Data Velocity deals with the speed at which data flows in from sources like business processes, application logs, networks, and social media sites, sensors, Mobile devices, etc. The flow of data is massive and continuous.

<strong>  (iv) Variability </strong> – This refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by the data at times, thus hampering the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.
